# variantstore
This project is a few goals:
1. Install and test some of the available variant store implementations:
  
    a. seqr -- from Broad Institute
  
    b. Gene42's variant store
 
    c. custom interface using R-Shiny
  
2. Identify features that are 

  "important and need to be implemented" vs features that are "nice to have" vs those that are "useful but not needed at the moment.

3. What should be the final implementation?
  
    a. Take one of the existing ones and build additional features? --> this assumes that there is no current implementation that is good.
  
    b. Build from scratch?
  
    c. Would this fall under the Genomics4RD umbrella?
 4. Set up jira-github integration
